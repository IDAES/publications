    This function returns a tracking cost expression for the given time-indexed
    variables and associated setpoint data.

    Arguments
    ---------
    variables: list
        List of time-indexed variables to include in the tracking cost
        expression
    time: iterable
        Set by which to index the tracking expression
    setpoint_data: dict
        Maps variable names to setpoint values
    weight_data: dict
        Optional. Maps variable names to tracking cost weights. If not

    Returns
    -------
    Pyomo Expression, indexed by time, containing the sum of weighted
    squared difference between variables and setpoint values.
