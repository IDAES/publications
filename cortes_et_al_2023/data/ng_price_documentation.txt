The natural gas prices for historical LMPs where taken from the eia.gov 
website.  For 2019, the anual price of gas for power production was used.
Since the data for 2022 is incloplete the average monthly available for
January to August was used.  Data for some months and some states was 
withheld so the average of monthly data may exclude some months.

Regardless of the gas use (power production or hydrogen production) the
power price was used.  There does not seem to be a major differnce between
power and industiral use analysis, and assuming the same price greatly
simplifies the analysis.

The following state data was used:
  * California -> CIASO 
  * Texas -> ERCOT (all regions)
  * Massachusetts -> ISO New England
  * New York -> ISO NY
  * Indiana -> MYSO_INDIANA
  * Indiana (Louisiana Not Available) -> MYSO_LOUISIANA
  * Indiana (Minnesota Not Available) -> MYSO_MINNESOTA
  * Pennsylvania -> PJM_WEST
  * South Dakota -> SPP_NORTH
  * Kansas (OK not available) -> SPP_SOUTH
