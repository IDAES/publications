Robust Optimization of the PZ/AFS Process Model
=======================

This directory will contain the code used to produce the results in the paper "Epistemic Uncertainty Analysis and Robust Optimization of a Second-Generation Solvent-Based Post-Combustion Carbon Capture Process"

### Disclaimer
This code was developed at Carnegie Mellon University by Ilayda Akkor and Chrysanthos E. Gounaris, 
as part of a research project funded by The Dow Chemical Company. In particular, we acknowledge the close 
collaboration with the following researchers from Dow: Shachit S. Iyer, John Dowdle and Le Wang, 
who provided key contributions pertaining to the project conceptualization, the research design 
and the methodology, model design choices and rationales, and the discussions of the results.
